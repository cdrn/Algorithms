# Algorithms
This is a repository of algorithm implementations. The aim of this repository is to act as a kind of personal notebook for algorithms and data structures.

## Destructions
The Algorithms/datastructures are for the most part implemented in python. The naming convention for each should be lower_case_with_underscores.py, and come with a lower_case_with_underscores_tests.py file to verify implmentation.
